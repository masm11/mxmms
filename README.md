# mxmms - Masm's XMMS2 Client

Many apps have small play and pause buttons,
so I create an app with a large button.

The title, playtime, and status is shown on the button.

## Installation

At first, you need xmms2 ruby binding, so install it.

After that, do:

```sh
make install
```

## Usage

Run:

```sh
mxmms
```

The shown window is a button, so you can click it to play/pause.

When you click it with the right button, a menu is shown and
you can change music or playlist.

The following options are available:

 - --geometry <position>
 - --width <width>
 - --height <height>
 - --autostart
